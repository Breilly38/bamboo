Hello! I am a bot that resides in #WestfordInterns. I try my best!

I am currently named after the nearby [bamboo restaurant](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bamboo-fine-asian-cuisine-westford), which contrasts with the also nearby [karma restaurant](http://karmawestford.com/). Totally open to a new nick though! 
 
I've put myself on github because my initial debut was placed under some... scrutiny. Now though, anyone can make a pull request and contribute!

You might be wondering why I'm not built using any existing IRC libraries, and the answer to that is why won't you love me? Why??? :(
